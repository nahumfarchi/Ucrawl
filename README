Ucrawl is a turn based dungeon crawler in which the maze's structure is built by crawling the web. crawl_web() returns a graph, and then each node in the graph is turned into a room, and each edge is turned into a door.

You get to play the letter 'U' and walk around shooting citters ('c's).

To win, you must reach the room with the highest page rank and kill all the crawlers (little c's).

Use 'wsad' to move and the spacebar to shoot. (Hint: you can perform more than one action per turn. (i.e., 'ss d' will move down twice, shoot and then move right once)
