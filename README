Ucrawler is a turn-based dungeon crawler in which the maze is generated by crawling a seed web page. 

The maze's structure is built from the graph returned by crawl_web(). The size of each room and the amount of crawlers in it depends on it's page rank.

To win, you must reach the page with the highest page rank and kill all the crawlers (little c's).

Use 'wsad' to move and the spacebar to shoot. (Hint: you can do more than one action per turn. (ie 'ss d' will move down twice, shoot and then move right once)

A typical turn of the game looks like so (you are the 'U', 'c' are enemies, '*' are bullets and '@' are doors):
